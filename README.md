# CodeQuiz

PseudoCode:

On the home page
    - Highscore page left upper corner 
    - Timer set to zero right upper corner
    - First div (probably one in HTML) with rules and start button

You click start button to start quiz.

Then questions pop up
    - Do I replace/clear the div? Or create a selector?
    - There's a question and then four buttons with choices
    - When I click the right answer it changes tally +1, tells you "correct" and moves to the next question (if, else? Or if, if else?)
    - When I click any of the wrong answers it changes tally -1, tells you "wrong" and moves to the next question 
    - this goes through all of the questions (five questions)
    - There is a timer counting down 60 seconds. If it reaches 0 it changes wrong tally -1 for each question not answered

At the end of the questions "you finish" and your score. This score needs to be locally logged and then added to high score list.

If you click on high score list it will show you those scores
    - You keep adding to object? 

You can clear the high score list
